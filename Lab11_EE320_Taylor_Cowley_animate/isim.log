*****  Notice! *****
** This memory model has been modified for the ECEN 320 frame buffer laboratory. 
** The memory model does not behave as described in the device data sheet. 
** The memory model will not simulate writes and will provide the following data on a read:
**  - the model will output 'X' values when invalid image locations are read
**  - For a valid image location, a memory read will return:
**    data[15:12] - addr[21:18]
**    data[11:8] - addr[2:0] & '1'
**    data[7:4] - addr[12:9]
**    data[3:0] - addr[2:0] & '0'
