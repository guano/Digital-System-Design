Question:
What is the purpose of the ST-3232 chip used on the Nexys2 board?

	It converts the logic from the FPGA into the proper RS-232 voltages- we can just give it logic 0 or logic 1 and it will transmit it properly.
	
	
Question:
What is the purpose of the “start” bit in the serial protocol?

	It signals the start of a character frame but does not contain data.


Question:
In what order are the bits sent over the UART? Least significant bit (LSB) first or Most significant bit
(MSB) first?
	
	The bits are sent least significant to most significant.



Question:
For a 19,200 baud system serial communication link, how long does it take to transfer an 8-bit character
(including the start and stop bits)?	

	10 * 52.1 us = 521 usec



Question:
At 19200 baud, how many characters per second can be transmitted?

	19200 baud / 10 symbols per character = 1920 characters per second


Question:
What percent of transmission time is overhead (time of the start and stop bits divided by the total frame
time)?

	2/10 = 20%

Question:
Suppose a file of 10,000 bytes is to be sent over a line at 19200 bps.  How much time will it take in
seconds?

	10000 bytes = 100,000 symbols (including start and stop). 100,000 / 19200 = 5.208 seconds




Part 2

Question:
What is the purpose of the BIT_TIMER_COUNT constant used within the bit-timer circuit?
	It is what we need to count up to to measure the proper time for the baud period.
2604 cycles/ baud period
	


Question:
Why should the “transmit out” signal be registered with a flip-flop?

	Because it goes straight to the computer. We have to have it synchronous without any glitches.


Question:
What is the purpose of the RETRN state in the state machine?

	First, it is to be temptation for the student who really wants to spell things correctly but doesn't know that "return" is a VHDL reserved word. We need a state here because we are waiting for the "send character" to go low. - We only want to send one character at a time.


Question:
What value should be asserted on the TX output during the IDLE and RETRN states?

	A '1'.



PART 3

Question:
How long does the simulation take to complete? (i.e., when the “Test Done” message is printed)
