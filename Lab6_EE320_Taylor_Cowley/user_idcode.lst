# Format for JTAG IDCODE list:
# 
# Comments start with '#' and continues to end-of-line.
# 
# One entry per line.
# An entry represents a device family or an individual device.
#
# There are 5 fields per line, separated by a comma:
#  1) JTAG IDCODE in binary. 'x' matches a '0' or a '1'.
#     '_' characters are not significant, 
#     but helps readability for humans.
#     Manufacturer code is in the right-most bits.
#
#  2) JTAG instruction register length, a decimal value.
#  3) Use value '0'.
#  4) Use value '0'. 
#  5) Name of device or device family
#
#  When matching a device IDCODE (which is a binary value
#  without any 'x') against entries in this file:
#    - '_' are not significant.
#    - assume entries are sorted alphabetically. '0' comes before '1', 
#      which comes before 'x'.
#    - Matching the IDCODE is done from top to bottom in the sorted
#      list until there is a match.
#
#  The order of entries in this file is not significant. The program
#  which reads it will sort it alphabetically.
#
# Example of entries:
xxxx_0000_0000_0001_xxxx_0000_0010_1010,4,0,0,DeviceName1
xxxx_0000_0000_0101_xxxx_0000_0010_1010,4,0,0,DeviceName2
